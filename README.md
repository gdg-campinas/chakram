####Speeding up debug builds

The project uses multidex. To speed up the builds you need to set `minSdkLevel` to 21 and above. Our project uses 
`minSdk` property to override `minSdkLevel`. To do that, you should open Android Studio Compiler Settings and add a 
command line property like below: `-PminSdk=21`

Release
-------

The project has continuous distribution triggered by Travis CI. 

- Pushing to `master` branch -> alpha release
- Pushing to `release` branch -> beta release

_Note:_ Alpha release is a special build that **should not** be promoted to beta or production.

`release` branch is meant to be for production release. It is by default deployed to Beta. After a brief test there, it can be safely promoted to production.

Push triggers a release. 

When something is pushed to `master` or `release`, after a successful release, it always creates another commit increasing the version number and git tag. It's not necessary to tag manually.

####Best Practices

- Alpha release
  - Just merge `develop` into `master` and push to trigger an internal alpha release.
- Beta/Production release
  - Update `release` branch to latest `develop`
  - Increase version number in root `build.gradle` file
  - Make `versionBuild = 0`
  - Update `app/src/main/play/en-US/whatsnew` file for change log in Google Play Store
  - Commit the changes and push
  - After a successful release, merge `release` branch back into `develop`
